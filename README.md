# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

### Welcome to sorting visualizer project!

Sorting Algorithms are awesome to learn about and scince I came to know about these algos, I always wanted to compare different well known algorithms on basis of their time conplexities.

### So here we go!
This project gives us the visual perspective of how the algorithms work behind the scene and also shows the shape and form of algorithm on the go.

This project has the features of adjusting array size, adjusting the algorithm speed and generating new array for different algorithms.
